# Getting Started with Shopify Mobile Buy SDK for Xamarin.iOS

## Adding the Mobile App sales channel

Before you can get started with the iOS Buy SDK outside of Shopify, 
you'll need to enable the Mobile App sales channel in your Shopify admin. 
 
The Mobile App sales channel page contains your:

 - API Key
 - App ID

To add the channel:

 1. From your Shopify admin, click **Settings**, and then click **Sales Channels**.
 2. Under **Installed sales channels**, click **Add a new sales channel**.
 3. On the **Add sales channel** dialog, find **Mobile App**, and then click **Learn more**.
 4. In the dialog window that opens, click **Add channel**. This brings you to the
    **Integration** page.

The **Integration** page is where you'll find your API Key. After the mobile 
app has launched, you can review data that is specific to the Mobile App's 
sales from your Shopify Home.
